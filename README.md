# 🏗️ Recursive Human Pyramid Solver  

## 📜 Overview  
This project implements a **recursive function** to calculate the weight carried by any person in a **human pyramid**. Each individual (except for those in the bottom row) evenly distributes their weight across the two people below them.

## 🎯 Problem Explanation  
A **Human Pyramid** is a triangular structure where:
1. Every person in the pyramid **weighs 128 lbs**.
2. Each person **splits their weight evenly** on the two people below them.
3. The weight on a person's back **includes their own weight plus the accumulated weight of those they support**.
